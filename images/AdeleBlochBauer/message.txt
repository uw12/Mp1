Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I is a 1907 painting by Gustav Klimt. 
The painting was sold for a record $135 million in 2006 to the Neue Galerie, New York.
Adele Bloch-Bauer (1881â€“1925) was a wealthy member of Viennese society and a patron and close friend of Gustav Klimt.
Klimt originally titled the painting as Adele Bloch-Bauer, but Nazi soldiers seized the painting from the Bloch-Bauer home and 
displayed it in the early 1940s, removing the name and instead calling it The Woman in Gold so that it could be displayed without 
referencing a prominent Jewish family.
